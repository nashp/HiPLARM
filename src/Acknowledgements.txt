HiPLAR-M is designed to take advantage of the latest GPU and multi-core
technologies whilst still maintaining the characteristics and ideas of the
Matrix package on which it depends. To that end, we have kept the
structure and code of the original Matrix package in place where
possible whilst inserting our own specialised code for the MAGMA and
PLASMA libraries with minimal changes. Some documentation of that
package also appears in the HiPLAR-M documentation. We wish to
acknowledge the work of Martin Maechler and Douglas Bates here as
HiPLAR-M would not exist without their previous and ongoing work
